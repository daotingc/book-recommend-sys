# HAVE NOT FINISHED IT YET
#### Hello world.🥸

## BEFORE YOU READ IT
I enrolled in COMP3900 22T1 and this WAS the project I participated in. However, I quited for some reasons.
It is an interesting project and I want to implement it in my way. I'm pretty sure these codes are TOTALLY written by me without any help from my team, and I cannot access the team repo from 03/12/2022. Therefore, I reckon I can use these codes in my private repo.

It is not a perfect project for sure, and you may have better ideas to implement some functions. Also, it may contain some bugs I did not cover. I am welcome to hear some ideas and thoughts with kind discussion. Rude actions and arrogant words will be ignored.
 
Please contact with me `daotingc@gmail.com` if you have any problem.

Thanks! Daoting C
